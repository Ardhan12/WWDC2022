# WWDC2022

I made an application to introduce the history of the Minangkabau name in the West Sumatra area. because as a Minang people, I think it is important for every individual in West Sumatra to know the origin of the name Minangkabau which is a self-entity. because we can't be called Minang people if we don't know the history of Minangkabau itself.
Another reason I made this application is because the story of the origin of the name Minangkabau is usually given to children in the Minangkabau Natural Culture subject when they are in elementary school. But not all children like the lesson, so I want to increase their interest by making stories that have animation and make them understand more about the origins of Minangkabau.
